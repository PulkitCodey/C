REALITY
The married ones are thinking of divorce
while the unmarried wish to be married
the young want to grow old
while the old wish they could turn back time
the unknown want fame
while the famous want privacy
the poor want to become rich
while the rich wish for the things they lost chasing wealth
the grass will always seem greener
but nothing grows without watering what's already yours
the truth is...
no one has it all
but everyone has enough
if only they stopped and took a moment to see it.
